 * \brief Verify a separate bit is used for each light color.
 *
 * Because of 5 lamp lights, the traffic light permits multiple
 * simultaneous outputs.
 *  Using a bit field to specify
 * directions requires that each constant occupy a separate bit.
 * To verify this, a cumulative field is used. It is initialized to
 * one of the constants. A bit is new if and only if or-ing it with
 * the field is different. This check is performed for each successive
 * constant in the set, then that constant is added to the field.
